# CCS-221-Midterm-Activity
Im not gonna lie sir and to anyone who reads this, Ive been struggling on my coding subjects. So I choosed this design for my mandala activity since it is easy. I used gold color code for the mandala and black background because I wanted it to have a killmonger theme, like the antagonist from Black Panther. My reference is from this youtube video https://youtu.be/_yvlOT5AnHY.
